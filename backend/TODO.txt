1. make a collection to store user comments. (type will be object_id, ref is User), so {user, comments, course(from course db)}....
 alternatively, we can create a form, take in user comments, then the user comments will just be based off the users _id since we have the requireAuth, add timetaken too, then we list all the comments out based of time... and only show delete button for the users own comment, in react need useContext to show the live updates of comments....
2. have a api for adding comments, and deleting comments ( we will do so by taking in the user's id through req._id, as we go through the require auth....)
3. api for showing comments, react will have to be able to show comments once user added
